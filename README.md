## Versions are kept in separate Branches
Version 1 (original): master<br/>
Version 2: version2

### master
My initial attempt at creating the solution.
- \- Didn't use abstract classes, or List/ArrayList
- \- Manual approach to adding required class instances where they needed to be
+ \+ Fun

### version2
Second attempt, using help from forum and other student's solutions as reference.<br/>
I use a controller object to help minimize coupling between the main program and all the other classes.
- \- Using `instanceof` to build the List to have `fly()`
+ \+ Uses abstract classes
+ \+ Uses List/ArrayList
+ \+ Works

Obviously don't copy and paste the code.  It's not that good, and you won't learn anything!  For copyright purposes, do what you like, except say it's yours.
